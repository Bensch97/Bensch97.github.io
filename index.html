        <h4>My day</h4>
        <p>We've been talking a lot today and it's been <em>killing</em> me, I'm so glad to finally be cranking away at something.</p>
        <h5>My Night</h5>
        <p>Probably will do one of the following 
            <ul>
                <li>Watch a Movie</li>
                <li>Binge some Ozark</li>
                <li>Play some Fortnite</li>
            </ul>
         </p>
         <h2>My Future</h2>
        <p>Probably going to be much too busy to get to anyone personally, make sure you get to my <a href="https://github.com/Bensch97">github</a> before that blows up.</p>
        <h2>How today is going</h2>
        <p>I'm now thinking of this project as a semi-essay and its making it <strong>very</strong> hard to think of ways to incorportate the tags we're supposed to.</p>
